# Gift Exchange Timer

This application is intended to help expedidite White Elephant Gift Exchanges for large Groups.

Its been observed that in a group with 50 to 100 participants it can take several hours for a White Elephant Gift Exchange.  This is due to a number of factors.
    1. Number of participants
    2. Serial nature of participation 1 person opening a gift at a time
    3. Indecisiveness of participants choosing to Steal or unwrapping a new gift
    4. Number of steals/gift allowed
    5. confusion of counts of steals for each gift and whether a gift is still available to "steal"

To help expedite a gift exchange many groups limit the number of steals/gift(4), limit the number of participants(1), or parallelize the gift opening by calling two or more participants to open gifts at a time.

Still that isn't always sufficient for reducing the duration for large groups.

This application aims to help expedite Gift Exchanges while including as many participants as possible, by limiting confusion with actually timers to track individual participants, and maintain a record of gifts stolen.
