### Co-Pilot Prompt:
    Help me write a Javascript application, served as a web page,  that creates and displays countdown timers.  The number of timers and default countdown time should be user configurable from the page.  Once the user clicks "continue" the user configured number of timers should be displayed horizontally adjacent, with over on rows below.   Each timer should be independent, with its own "start", "pause" and "reset" buttons.  Also each timer should have an editable text field above the timer, with the default text being the number  of that timer, starting with "1".   As the timers get down to 10seconds left, the digits font size should increase for that timer.  When the timer reaches 0, text should display over the timer  "Times Up!".
